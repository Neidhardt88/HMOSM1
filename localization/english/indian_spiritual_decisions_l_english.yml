  master_dharana_desc:0 "To practice dharana, the perceiver focuses fully on a single object, called the pratyaya. He strives to block out intrusive thoughts and remain centred on the pratyaya. Dharana is the first step of deep concentration meditation, by which the pratyaya is firmly retained in the mind, but the perceiver remains aware of the separation between himself, the perceived object and the act of meditation. In Hinduism, dharana is the sixth of eight limbs in Patanjali's Yoga Sutras."

  master_dhyana_desc:0 "When the perceiver has mastered dharana, he is able to focus his awareness solely on the object of contemplation (pratyaya). At this point, he grasps the trichotomy formed by himself as the perceiver, the perceived object (pratyaya) and the act of perceiving. By learning to minimise his role as the perceiver, he achieves dhyana, a state of consciousness in which he merges with the perceived object in a process involving breathing control and acute mental focus. Dhyana is distinct from dharana because the perceiver becomes actively engaged with the object of focus. In dhyana, the perceiver is unaware of the act of meditation and is only conscious that his mind and the pratyaya exist. Dhyana means slightly different things in the Jainist, Buddhist and Hindu traditions. It likely began in the Sramanic culture of ancient India (6th century BC) and developed in parallel in all three traditions, which mututally influenced each other. In Hinduism, dhyana is the seventh of eight limbs in Patajali's Yoga Sutras."

  master_samadhi_desc:0 "When the perceiver can sustain focus on the pratyaya for an extended period of time and collapse his self-consciousness, the practice of dhyana gives way to samadhi (absorption) and the perceiver melds with the pratyaya. In the Yoga Sutras, the sage Patanjali compares this to placing a clear gem on a coloured surface, whereby the gem appears to turn the same colour. In samadhi, the consciousness of the perceiver fuses with the object of thought, the pratyaya. The pratyaya is like the coloured surface and the perceiver's consciousness is like the transparent gem. Often translated as 'concentration' or 'unification of mind', samadhi is a dissolution of the ego and the last of the eight elements of Buddhism's Noble Eightfold Path. In Hinduism, it is the eighth limb of the Yoga Sutras, following the sixth limb (dharana) and the seventh limb (dhyana)."
