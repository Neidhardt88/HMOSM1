Let us form the Indo-Greek Kingdom, an amalgamation of Indus cultures and our Greco homeland, and prosper far into the future.\nWe have an opportunity here, to move the heartland of our nation deeper into our new land, integrate ourselves into this culture, or we stay here, in our currently established home and rule from afar."
